1) go to: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py(python3 is required to be on your machine to install this
* sudo apt-get install python3-distutils
* sudo python3 get-pip.py

2) dependencies needed:
* sudo apt-get install -y    python3-pip    build-essential    git     python    python3-dev
* sudo apt-get install -y    libsdl2-dev    libsdl2-image-dev    libsdl2-mixer-dev    libsdl2-ttf-dev    libportmidi-dev    libswscale-dev    libavformat-dev    libavcodec-dev    zlib1g-dev
* sudo apt-get install cython
* sudo pip3 install kivy

3 running the python file
* python3 main.py

4) converting the python file to .apk using buildozer
==> intalling the dependencies for the bulldozer framework
* sudo apt-get install libltdl-dev libffl-dev libssl-dev autoconf autotools-dev
* sudo apt install -y git zip unzip openjdk-8-jdk python3-pip autoconf  libtool pkg-config zlibig-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libtinfo5 cmake libffi-dev libssl-dev 
* pip install --user --upgrade cython==0.29.19 virtualenv # the --user should be removed if you do this in a venv
==> making this particular path available through the terminal open
*export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/
==> clear the terminal and navigate to desktop
* cd desktop/
==> to see directory in desktop
* ls -lstr
==> downloading bulldozer in desktop directory
* git clone https://github.com/kivy/buildozer.git
==> to see the buildozer folder and all files inside it
* ls
==> navigate to the buildozer
* cd buildozer/
==> do the intsallation setup of buildozer in our machine
* sudo python3 setup.py install
==> initializing the builddozer in the director where our python was saved
* cd ..
* buildozer init
==> command to generate apk file. this file will be in a bin directory
* buildozer android debug

6) copy the apk file to your mobile phone. you can open it from our mobile phone. with this, 
you can install the app without donloading it from playstore
